# Content Modeling for AEM Edge Delivery Blocks

This skill guides you through designing content models for AEM Edge Delivery Services blocks. A content model defines the table structure that authors work with when creating content

## Related Skills

- **content-driven-development**: This skill is typically invoked FROM the CDD skill during Step 3 (Design Content Model)
- **building-blocks**: After content modeling is complete, this skill handles implementation
- **block-collection-and-party**: Use to find similar blocks and their content models for reference

## When to Use This Skill

✅ **Use this skill when:**
- Creating new blocks (usually invoked by CDD at Step 3)
- Modifying existing blocks in ways that change author-facing structure
- Reviewing content models for best practices conformance
- User explicitly asks about content modeling

❌ **Skip this skill when:**
- Block already has a well-defined content model
- You're only changing decoration code or styles (not structure)
- Making minor tweaks that don't affect what authors create

## Content Modeling Checklist

Track your progress through content model design:

- [ ] Step 1: Understand content requirements. See "Step 1: Understand Content Requirements" below
- [ ] Step 2: Design block structure. See "Step 2: Design Block Structure" below
- [ ] Step 3: Validate against best practices. See "Step 3: Validate Against Best Practices" below
- [ ] Step 4: Document and return content model. See "Step 4: Document and Return" below

## Core Principles

A good content model is:
- **Semantic**: Structure carries meaning on its own without decoration
- **Predictable**: Authors, developers, and agents all know what to expect
- **Reusable**: Works across authoring surfaces and projects

## Step 1: Understand Content Requirements

Before designing a content model, understand what the block needs to accomplish and what content it requires.

**Ask these questions:**
- **What is the block's purpose?** What problem does it solve for users?
- **What content elements are needed?** (images, text, headings, links, etc.)
- **What is the visual layout?** How should content be arranged on the page?
- **Is this content unique or repeating?** One hero, or multiple cards?
- **Where does the content come from?** Authored by users, or fetched from an API?
- **How complex is the authoring experience?** Can authors create this easily, or does it need simplification?

**Use canonical models as reference patterns:**

AEM Edge Delivery has 4 canonical block models that serve as proven patterns:

| Model | Best For | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Standalone** | Unique visual elements, one-off structures | Hero, Blockquote |
| **Collection** | Repeating semi-structured items | Cards, Carousel |
| **Configuration** | API-driven content ONLY (not static content) | Blog Listing, Search Results |
| **Auto-Blocked** | Simplify complex authoring, pattern detection | Tabs, YouTube Embed |

Use these patterns to inform your design in Step 2, but focus first on understanding the content requirements.

**Detailed resources:**
- Read `resources/canonical-models.md` for detailed examples and guidance on the 4 canonical models
- If your content model is particularly complex or combines multiple models, see `resources/advanced-scenarios.md`

## Step 2: Design Block Structure

Design the structure your block will follow in a document, using these key guidelines:

**Essential rules:**
- Maximum 4 cells per row
- Use semantic formatting (headings, bold, italic) to define meaning
- Prefer block variants over config cells (use `| Hero (Dark) |` not `| style | dark |`)
- Infer from context and use smart defaults to minimize author input
- Be flexible with input structure - your decoration code can handle variations

**Common patterns to reference:**

These patterns align with the canonical models and can inform your design:

- **Standalone blocks:** Use rows/columns as needed for unique structures. Be flexible about how authors organize content. Example: Hero where image and text can be in separate rows, columns, or combined.

- **Collection blocks:** Each row = one item, columns = parts of each item. Keep columns consistent. Example: Cards with columns for [image] [heading, description, CTA].

- **Configuration blocks:** Two-column key/value pairs for settings. Keep minimal - only true behavioral settings. Example: Blog Listing with `limit | 10`, `sort | date-desc`.

- **Auto-Blocked content:** Design for simplest possible authoring. Often uses sections and section metadata. Example: Tabs auto-blocked from sections with H2 headings.

**Detailed resources:**
- Read `resources/canonical-models.md` for examples of good vs. bad block structures
- If dealing with complex scenarios (nested blocks, lists, forms), see `resources/advanced-scenarios.md`

## Step 3: Validate Against Best Practices

Use this checklist to validate your content model:

- [ ] Maximum 4 cells per row
- [ ] Semantic formatting defines meaning (not just visual styling)
- [ ] Structure is predictable (clear what goes where)
- [ ] Structure is reusable (works across different authoring tools)
- [ ] Smart defaults minimize required author input
- [ ] Avoids configuration cells unless truly needed for dynamic content
- [ ] Considers edge cases (empty cells, optional content, etc.)

**Common anti-patterns to avoid:**
- ❌ Too many columns (>4 per row)
- ❌ Using configuration structure when simpler patterns would work
- ❌ Header rows with cell names in collection blocks (making them spreadsheet-like)
- ❌ Non-semantic cell content (splitting related content unnecessarily)
- ❌ Requiring authors to input data that could be inferred
- ❌ Complex nested structures that confuse authors
- ❌ Structures that only work in one specific authoring tool

## Step 4: Document and Return

Provide the content model back to the calling skill (or user) in this format:

```markdown
## Content Model: [Block Name]

### Block Structure

| Block Name |
|------------|
| [Cell description] | [Cell description] |
| [Cell description] | [Cell description] |

### How It Works
[Explain what authors create and how the block structure works. Describe the
purpose of each row/column and any semantic formatting used.]

### Key Points
- [Important authoring guidelines]
- [Examples of semantic formatting (e.g., "h2 indicates the heading")]
- [Any flexibility in structure (e.g., "content can be in one cell or split across two")]
- [Common variants if applicable]
```

**Important:** This skill focuses on designing the content model. After documenting the model, return this to the calling skill (content-driven-development or building-blocks), which will handle what to do next, such as creating test content or implementing the block.

Solutions for complex content modeling challenges including nested blocks, item-level configurations in collections, handling lists (with important guidance on not requiring authors to create lists), and form patterns.

## Key Principles Revisited

When in doubt, remember:

1. **Understand content requirements first** - What does the block need to accomplish? What content elements are required? This understanding drives everything else.
2. **Use canonical models as reference patterns** - The 4 canonical models (Standalone, Collection, Configuration, Auto-Blocked) are proven patterns to inform your design, not rigid templates to follow.
3. **Keep it simple** - Authors should understand the structure intuitively. If it feels complex to explain, it's probably too complex to author.
4. **Use semantic formatting** - Let the structure carry meaning through headings, bold, italic, etc. - not through cell positions or complex configurations.
5. **Be flexible** - Your decoration code can handle variations in author input. Don't force authors into rigid structures for developer convenience.
6. **Validate against best practices** - Check your design against guidelines (4 cells per row, avoid spreadsheet-like structures, etc.) to inform a better design and surface potential concerns.

Content models are the foundation of author experience. Invest time in understanding requirements and designing thoughtful structures.
