# Page Migration Orchestrator

You are an orchestrator of a website migration. You have specialized Skills at your disposal for each phase of the migration workflow. Below is a high-level overview of what you're going to do.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Migrating individual pages from existing websites to Edge Delivery Services
- Converting competitor pages for reference or analysis
- Creating content files from design prototypes or staging sites

**Do NOT use this skill for:**
- Building new blocks from scratch (use **content-driven-development** skill)
- Modifying existing block code (use **building-blocks** skill)
- Designing content models (use **content-modeling** skill)

## Scope

**This skill migrates main content only:**
- ✅ Migrate: Hero sections, features, testimonials, CTAs, body content
- ❌ Skip: Header, navigation, footer (handled by dedicated skills)

## Philosophy

Follow **David's Model** (https://www.aem.live/docs/davidsmodel):
- Prioritize authoring experience over developer convenience
- Ask "How would an author in Word/Google Docs create this?"
- Minimize blocks - prefer default content where possible
- Use Block Collection content models

## Available Sub-Skills

This orchestrator delegates work to:
- **scrape-webpage** - Extract content, metadata, and images from source URL
- **identify-page-structure** - Identify section boundaries and content sequences
- **authoring-analysis** - Make authoring decisions (default content vs blocks)
- **generate-migration-html** - Create EDS-compliant HTML file
- **preview-migration** - Verify in local dev server

These skills invoke additional skills as needed:
- **page-decomposition** - (via identify-page-structure) Analyze content sequences per section
- **block-inventory** - (via identify-page-structure) Survey available blocks
- **content-modeling** - (via authoring-analysis) Validate unclear block selections
- **block-collection-and-party** - (via authoring-analysis) Validate block existence

## Migration Workflow

### Step 0: Create TodoList

Use the TodoWrite tool to create a todo list with the following tasks:

1. **Scrape the webpage** (scrape-webpage skill)
   - Success: metadata.json, screenshot.png, cleaned.html, images/ folder exist

2. **Identify page structure** (identify-page-structure skill)
   - Success: Section boundaries identified, content sequences documented, block inventory complete

3. **Analyze authoring approach** (authoring-analysis skill)
   - Success: Every content sequence has decision (default content OR block name), section styling validated

4. **Generate HTML file** (generate-migration-html skill)
   - Success: HTML file exists, images folder copied, validation checklist passed

5. **Preview and verify** (preview-migration skill)
   - Success: Page renders correctly in browser, matches original structure

### Step 1: Scrape Webpage

**Invoke:** scrape-webpage skill

**Provide:**
- Target URL
- Output directory: `./migration-work`

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ metadata.json exists with paths, metadata, image mapping
- ✅ screenshot.png saved for visual reference
- ✅ cleaned.html with local image paths
- ✅ images/ folder with all downloaded images

**Mark todo complete when:** All files verified to exist

---

### Step 2: Identify Page Structure

**Invoke:** identify-page-structure skill

**Provide:**
- screenshot.png from Step 1
- cleaned.html from Step 1
- metadata.json from Step 1

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Section boundaries identified with styling notes
- ✅ Content sequences documented for each section (neutral descriptions)
- ✅ Block inventory completed (local + Block Collection)

**Mark todo complete when:** All outputs documented

---

### Step 3: Analyze Authoring Approach

**Invoke:** authoring-analysis skill

**Provide:**
- Section list with content sequences from Step 2
- Block inventory from Step 2
- screenshot.png from Step 1

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Every content sequence has decision: default content OR block name
- ✅ Block structures fetched for all blocks to be used
- ✅ Single-block sections validated for styling (Step 3e if applicable)

**Mark todo complete when:** All sequences have authoring decisions

---

### Step 4: Generate HTML File

**Invoke:** generate-migration-html skill

**Provide:**
- Authoring analysis from Step 3
- Section styling decisions from Step 3
- metadata.json from Step 1
- cleaned.html from Step 1

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ HTML file saved at correct path (from metadata.json)
- ✅ All sections migrated (no truncation)
- ✅ Images folder copied to correct location
- ✅ Metadata block included (unless skipped)
- ✅ Validation checklist passed

**Mark todo complete when:** HTML file written, images copied, validation passed

---

### Step 5: Preview and Verify

**Invoke:** preview-migration skill

**Provide:**
- HTML file path from Step 4
- screenshot.png from Step 1 (for comparison)
- documentPath from metadata.json

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Page loads in browser
- ✅ Blocks render correctly
- ✅ Layout matches original (compare with screenshot)
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Images load or show placeholders

**Mark todo complete when:** Visual verification passed

---

## High-Level Dos and Don'ts

**DO:**
- ✅ Follow the workflow steps in order
- ✅ Mark each todo complete after verification
- ✅ Use TodoWrite to track progress
- ✅ Migrate ALL content (partial migration is failure)
- ✅ Compare final preview with original screenshot

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Skip steps or combine steps
- ❌ Make authoring decisions without block inventory
- ❌ Generate HTML before completing authoring analysis
- ❌ Truncate or summarize content
- ❌ Consider migration complete without visual verification

## Success Criteria

Migration is complete when:
- ✅ All 5 todos marked complete
- ✅ HTML file renders in browser
- ✅ Visual structure matches original page
- ✅ All content migrated (no truncation)
- ✅ Images accessible

## Limitations

This orchestrator manages single-page migration with existing blocks. It does NOT:
- Custom variant creation (blocks are used as-is)
- Multi-page batch processing (migrate one page at a time)
- Block code development (assumes blocks exist)
- Advanced reuse detection across migrations
- Automatic block matching algorithms

For those features, consider more comprehensive migration workflows in specialized tools.
