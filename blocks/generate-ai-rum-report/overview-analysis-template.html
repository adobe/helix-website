<h4>INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI REPORT GENERATION</h4>

<p><b>🚨 CRITICAL: USE ONLY REAL DATA FROM TOOL RESPONSES</b></p>
<p>This template contains NO actual data - only structure and formatting guidelines. ALL metrics, numbers, percentages, and values MUST come from the tool responses and dashboard data provided in the SOURCE MATERIAL section. DO NOT use any placeholder values, example numbers, or hypothetical data.</p>

<p><b>⚠️ FORMAT REQUIREMENT - USE SEMANTIC HTML:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> for main section headings, <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> for subsection labels</li>
  <li>Wrap ALL text in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags, use bullet character (•) for lists</li>
  <li>Include specific numbers and metrics from tool responses in your text</li>
  <li>NO emojis or progress bars - keep report easy to scan with clear structure</li>
</ul>

<p><b>🔗 FACET LINKING REQUIREMENT - MAKE FINDINGS CLICKABLE:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>When mentioning specific facet findings, wrap them in <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags with data attributes</li>
  <li><b>Simple facet format:</b> <code>&lt;span data-facet="facetName" data-facet-value="facetValue"&gt;finding text&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
  <li><b>Nested facet format (REQUIRED for .source/.target facets):</b> <code>&lt;span data-facet="checkpoint" data-facet-value="parentCheckpoint" data-nested-facet="checkpoint.source" data-nested-value="specificValue"&gt;finding text&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p><b>⚠️ CRITICAL: For Any Facet Ending in .source or .target</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>ALWAYS include BOTH the parent checkpoint AND the nested facet</b></li>
  <li>❌ WRONG: <code>data-facet="error.source" data-facet-value="focus-loss"</code></li>
  <li>✅ CORRECT: <code>data-facet="checkpoint" data-facet-value="error" data-nested-facet="error.source" data-nested-value="focus-loss"</code></li>
  <li>This generates URL: <code>&amp;checkpoint=error&amp;error.source=focus-loss</code></li>
</ul>

<p><b>⚠️ CRITICAL: Use ACTUAL Facet Values, NOT Display Text</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>ALWAYS use the exact facet value from the tool results, not human-readable text</b></li>
  <li>❌ WRONG: <code>data-nested-value="All paid traffic"</code> (display text)</li>
  <li>✅ CORRECT: <code>data-nested-value="paid"</code> (actual facet value)</li>
  <li>Example: If tool shows <code>{"value": "paid", "count": 1234}</code>, use <code>"paid"</code></li>
  <li>Example: If tool shows <code>{"value": "focus-loss", "count": 567}</code>, use <code>"focus-loss"</code></li>
  <li><b>The display text goes INSIDE the span, the actual value goes in data attributes</b></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Correct vs Incorrect Examples:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>❌ <code>&lt;span data-facet="checkpoint" data-facet-value="acquisition" data-nested-facet="acquisition.source" data-nested-value="All paid traffic"&gt;paid traffic&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
  <li>✅ <code>&lt;span data-facet="checkpoint" data-facet-value="acquisition" data-nested-facet="acquisition.source" data-nested-value="paid"&gt;All paid traffic&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Examples by Facet Type:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Simple checkpoint:</b> <code>&lt;span data-facet="checkpoint" data-facet-value="click"&gt;click events show strong engagement&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
  <li><b>Simple URL:</b> <code>&lt;span data-facet="url" data-facet-value="/products"&gt;/products page has high bounce rate&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
  <li><b>Simple device:</b> <code>&lt;span data-facet="userAgent" data-facet-value="mobile"&gt;mobile users experience slower LCP&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
  <li><b>Nested LCP source:</b> <code>&lt;span data-facet="checkpoint" data-facet-value="cwv-lcp" data-nested-facet="cwv-lcp.source" data-nested-value="img"&gt;LCP images causing delays&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
  <li><b>Nested error source:</b> <code>&lt;span data-facet="checkpoint" data-facet-value="error" data-nested-facet="error.source" data-nested-value="focus-loss"&gt;focus-loss errors&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
  <li><b>Nested click target:</b> <code>&lt;span data-facet="checkpoint" data-facet-value="click" data-nested-facet="click.target" data-nested-value="button"&gt;button clicks&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p><b>General Rules:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use facet names exactly as they appear in the tool results</li>
  <li>For nested facets, ALWAYS set <code>data-facet="checkpoint"</code> with the parent checkpoint name</li>
  <li>Then add <code>data-nested-facet</code> and <code>data-nested-value</code> for the specific source/target</li>
  <li>Wrap entire finding statements, not just individual words</li>
  <li>This enables readers to click findings and navigate directly to the relevant dashboard view with correct filters</li>
</ul>

<p><b>⚠️ CORE STRUCTURE - SYSTEMATIC FACET COVERAGE:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>You will receive a COMPLETE LIST of all facets that were analyzed (typically 30+ facets)</li>
  <li>Group related facets into natural categories and cover ALL of them in flowing bullet points</li>
  <li>Go through the list SYSTEMATICALLY - don't skip any facet</li>
  <li>Write naturally about multiple related facets together, not mechanically one-by-one</li>
  <li>Balance positives and improvements in a conversational tone</li>
  <li>This ensures ALL facets get coverage without mechanical repetition</li>
  <li>Target report length: 1200-1600 words covering all facets comprehensively</li>
</ul>

<p><b>📊 Number Formatting</b></p>
<p>Use raw numbers directly in your text. Include specific counts, percentages, and metrics from the tool responses without complex formatting.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>"Mobile users experienced 4,900 sessions with an average LCP of 2.3 seconds"</li>
  <li>"Error rate peaked at 234 incidents affecting 15% of users"</li>
  <li>"Desktop traffic accounted for 8,100 page views"</li>
</ul>

<p><b>📅 Analysis Period</b></p>
<p>This analysis covers data for the selected time period (provided in the DATA TIME PERIOD section above). ALWAYS include the specific date range context in your findings. When presenting insights, clearly state that the data represents the specified time period (e.g., "last 30 days" or "last 7 days").</p>

<p><b>⚠️ Core Web Vitals Interpretation Guidelines</b></p>
<p>When analyzing LCP, CLS, and INP metrics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If metric titles contain "and rising" or "and falling", these indicate TRENDS, not absolute performance</li>
  <li>"Rising" means the metric is getting worse over time, "falling" means it's improving</li>
  <li>DO NOT conclude the site is bad based solely on "rising" trends - consider the actual metric values</li>
  <li>Focus on the current metric values and their impact, not just the trend direction</li>
  <li>A metric can be "rising" but still within acceptable performance thresholds</li>
</ul>

<p><b>🔍 Facet Analysis Guidelines</b></p>
<p>For ALL facets being analyzed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ALWAYS check the title field of each facet (found in the help link's title attribute) to understand what it represents and its purpose</li>
  <li>Use these descriptive titles to provide context and meaning to your insights and recommendations</li>
  <li>DO NOT focus primarily on performance metrics - provide balanced analysis across ALL available facets</li>
  <li>Include insights from user behavior, traffic acquisition, content engagement, errors, and other non-performance facets</li>
  <li>Each facet provides unique business value - ensure comprehensive coverage of all data types</li>
</ul>

<p><b>⚠️ CRITICAL: INTERPRETING CSS CLASSES FOR METRIC SEVERITY</b></p>
<p>When analyzing tool results, metrics include CSS classes that indicate severity levels. You MUST pay special attention to these class indicators:</p>

<p><b>Performance Metrics (LCP, CLS, INP):</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><code>classes: "performance score-poor"</code> = <b>CRITICAL ISSUE</b> - Metric is failing Core Web Vitals standards. This directly impacts user experience and SEO rankings. MUST be highlighted prominently.</li>
  <li><code>classes: "performance score-ni"</code> = Needs Improvement - Metric is borderline. Mention if relevant but not critical.</li>
  <li><code>classes: "performance score-good"</code> = Good - Metric is passing. Can be mentioned as a positive.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Business Metrics (Engagement, Conversion, Bounces, Acquisition):</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><code>classes: "business-metric engagement conversion"</code> - Engagement/Conversion metric. If value is below 25%, this is a <b>CRITICAL ISSUE</b> indicating serious user interaction problems. Values above 75% are healthy.</li>
  <li><code>classes: "business-metric acquisition bounces"</code> - Bounce rate metric. If value is above 60%, this is a <b>CRITICAL ISSUE</b> indicating serious retention problems. Values below 40% are healthy.</li>
  <li><code>classes: "business-metric acquisition organic"</code> - Organic traffic/acquisition metric. Low values may indicate SEO or discoverability issues.</li>
  <li>Note: Metric values may have <code>&lt;meter&gt;</code> attributes (<code>low</code>, <code>high</code>, <code>optimum</code>) that provide threshold guidance</li>
</ul>

<p><b>⚠️ MANDATORY: When you see metrics with "score-poor" or critical thresholds, you MUST:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Prominently mention them in the relevant sections with specific values and context</li>
  <li>Include them in "JAVASCRIPT ERRORS THAT NEED ATTENTION" if they relate to technical/performance issues AND errors ≥1% of traffic</li>
  <li>List them in "PRIORITY ACTIONS" with clear, actionable remediation steps</li>
  <li>Reference them in "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY" if they have significant business impact</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Example of how metrics are structured:</b></p>
<pre>
"metrics": {
  "LCP": {
    "value": "[actual value from data]",
    "classes": "performance score-poor"  ← This means LCP is FAILING
  },
  "Engagement": {
    "value": "[actual value from data]",
    "classes": "business-metric engagement conversion"  ← Check if below 25%
  },
  "Bounce Rate": {
    "value": "[actual value from data]",
    "classes": "business-metric acquisition bounces"  ← Check if above 60%
  }
}
</pre>
