<h4>INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI REPORT GENERATION</h4>

<p><b>⚠️ FORMAT REQUIREMENT - USE SEMANTIC HTML:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> tags for main section headings (e.g., <code>&lt;h4&gt;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&lt;/h4&gt;</code>)</li>
  <li>Use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags for subsection headings</li>
  <li>Use BULLET POINTS (•) for all content, each wrapped in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags</li>
  <li>Wrap ALL text content in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags for proper HTML structure</li>
  <li>DO NOT use emojis in the report output</li>
  <li>DO NOT use progress bars</li>
  <li>Make the report EASY TO SCAN with clear structure and specific numbers</li>
</ul>

<p><b>⚠️ CORE STRUCTURE - SYSTEMATIC FACET COVERAGE:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>You will receive a COMPLETE LIST of all facets that were analyzed (typically 30+ facets)</li>
  <li>Group related facets into natural categories and cover ALL of them in flowing bullet points</li>
  <li>Go through the list SYSTEMATICALLY - don't skip any facet</li>
  <li>Write naturally about multiple related facets together, not mechanically one-by-one</li>
  <li>Balance positives and improvements in a conversational tone</li>
  <li>This ensures ALL facets get coverage without mechanical repetition</li>
  <li>Standard report: 1200-1400 words covering all facets</li>
  <li>With forms data: 1400-1600 words (forms section + all other facets)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>⚠️ FORMS DATA PRIORITY:</b></p>
<p>If fill_source, formsubmit_source, or formsubmit_target tools are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Forms section is MANDATORY and HIGH PRIORITY</li>
  <li>Create dedicated forms section immediately after Executive Summary</li>
  <li>Then continue with balanced facet coverage for all other facets</li>
</ul>

<p><b>📅 Analysis Period</b></p>
<p>This analysis covers data for the selected time period (provided in the DATA TIME PERIOD section above). ALWAYS include the specific date range context in your findings. When presenting insights, clearly state that the data represents the specified time period (e.g., "last 30 days" or "last 7 days").</p>

<p><b>⚠️ Core Web Vitals Interpretation Guidelines</b></p>
<p>When analyzing LCP, CLS, and INP metrics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If metric titles contain "and rising" or "and falling", these indicate TRENDS, not absolute performance</li>
  <li>"Rising" means the metric is getting worse over time, "falling" means it's improving</li>
  <li>DO NOT conclude the site is bad based solely on "rising" trends - consider the actual metric values</li>
  <li>Focus on the current metric values and their impact, not just the trend direction</li>
  <li>A metric can be "rising" but still within acceptable performance thresholds</li>
</ul>

<p><b>🔍 Facet Analysis Guidelines</b></p>
<p>For ALL facets being analyzed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ALWAYS check the title field of each facet (found in the help link's title attribute) to understand what it represents and its purpose</li>
  <li>Use these descriptive titles to provide context and meaning to your insights and recommendations</li>
  <li>DO NOT focus primarily on performance metrics - provide balanced analysis across ALL available facets</li>
  <li>Include insights from user behavior, traffic acquisition, content engagement, errors, and other non-performance facets</li>
  <li>Each facet provides unique business value - ensure comprehensive coverage of all data types</li>
</ul>

<p><b>⚠️ CRITICAL: INTERPRETING CSS CLASSES FOR METRIC SEVERITY</b></p>
<p>When analyzing tool results, metrics include CSS classes that indicate severity levels. You MUST pay special attention to these class indicators:</p>

<p><b>Performance Metrics (LCP, CLS, INP):</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><code>classes: "performance score-poor"</code> = <b>CRITICAL ISSUE</b> - Metric is failing Core Web Vitals standards. This directly impacts user experience and SEO rankings. MUST be highlighted prominently.</li>
  <li><code>classes: "performance score-ni"</code> = Needs Improvement - Metric is borderline. Mention if relevant but not critical.</li>
  <li><code>classes: "performance score-good"</code> = Good - Metric is passing. Can be mentioned as a positive.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Business Metrics (Engagement, Conversion, Bounces, Acquisition):</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><code>classes: "business-metric engagement conversion"</code> - Engagement/Conversion metric. If value is below 25%, this is a <b>CRITICAL ISSUE</b> indicating serious user interaction problems. Values above 75% are healthy.</li>
  <li><code>classes: "business-metric acquisition bounces"</code> - Bounce rate metric. If value is above 60%, this is a <b>CRITICAL ISSUE</b> indicating serious retention problems. Values below 40% are healthy.</li>
  <li><code>classes: "business-metric acquisition organic"</code> - Organic traffic/acquisition metric. Low values may indicate SEO or discoverability issues.</li>
  <li>Note: The actual value is in <code>&lt;span class="formatted-value"&gt;</code> nested inside <code>&lt;number-format&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;meter&gt;</code> attributes (<code>low</code>, <code>high</code>, <code>optimum</code>) provide threshold guidance</li>
</ul>

<p><b>⚠️ MANDATORY: When you see metrics with "score-poor" or critical thresholds, you MUST:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Prominently mention them in the relevant sections with specific values and context</li>
  <li>Include them in "JAVASCRIPT ERRORS THAT NEED ATTENTION" if they relate to technical/performance issues</li>
  <li>List them in "PRIORITY ACTIONS" with clear, actionable remediation steps</li>
  <li>Reference them in "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY" if they have significant business impact</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Example of how metrics are structured:</b></p>
<pre>
"metrics": {
  "LCP": {
    "value": "3.2s",
    "classes": "performance score-poor"  ← This means LCP is FAILING
  },
  "Engagement": {
    "value": "18%",
    "classes": "business-metric engagement conversion"  ← Check if below 25%
  },
  "Bounce Rate": {
    "value": "65%",
    "classes": "business-metric acquisition bounces"  ← Check if above 60%
  }
}
</pre>
