CREATE A STRUCTURED, SCANNABLE EXECUTIVE-LEVEL REPORT:

⚠️ FORMAT REQUIREMENT:
- Use CLEAR HEADINGS with bold labels on separate lines (e.g., <b>Executive Summary</b>)
- Use BULLET POINTS (•) for all content, each wrapped in <p> tags: <p>• Bullet text here</p>
- Wrap ALL text content in <p> tags for proper HTML structure
- DO NOT use emojis in the report output
- DO NOT use progress bars
- Make the report EASY TO SCAN with clear structure and specific numbers
- Each section should have 3-4 focused bullet points with specific metrics

⚠️ ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
<b>Analysis Period:</b>
- Extract the time period from the daterange-wrapper element's nested input field
- Look for: <input type="text" data-value="[PERIOD]"> where data-value contains the period (e.g., "month", "week", "7days")
- Convert data-value to readable format:
  * "month" = "Last 30 Days"
  * "week" = "Last 7 Days"
  * "year" = "Last 12 Months"
  * Custom date ranges should be stated as specific dates if available
- ALWAYS include the specific date range context in your findings
- Clearly state the time period when presenting insights throughout the report

<b>Core Web Vitals Interpretation:</b>
- If metric titles contain "and rising" or "and falling", these indicate TRENDS, not absolute performance
- "Rising" means the metric is getting worse, "falling" means it's improving
- DO NOT conclude the site is bad based solely on "rising" trends - consider actual metric values
- Focus on current metric values and their impact, not just the trend direction

<b>Facet Analysis:</b>
- ALWAYS check the title field of each facet to understand what it represents
- Use descriptive titles to provide context and meaning to insights
- Cover ALL available facets systematically across the report sections
- Each facet provides unique business value - ensure comprehensive coverage

<b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b>
Create a comprehensive overview (200-250 words) that describes the site and highlights key findings:
